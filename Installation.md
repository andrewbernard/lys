#### Scheme code

The code uses some locally developed Scheme modules. Since Scheme can't easily
be packaged into a single executable bundle, the modules need to be placed in
known location and the Guile load path needs to be adjusted. While this may be
inconvenient, lilypond does the same thing. But since this code is not yet
part of lilypond core, and may never be, it is not appropriate to include the
local modules in the lilypond core scheme module area.
